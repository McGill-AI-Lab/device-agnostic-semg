Recent advances in **surface electromyography (sEMG) decoding**, such as **[Meta’s EMG2Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02725)**, **[EMG2QWERTY datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20081)**, and their associated pretrained models, have demonstrated high-accuracy hand-pose and typing reconstruction. However, these breakthroughs rely on **Meta’s proprietary acquisition hardware (sEMG-RD)**, limiting reproducibility and broader utility for independent research and open development. This repo aims to make the hardware, data, model pipeline **transparent, modifiable, and benchmarkable**.

1) **Custom acquisition hardware** (open-sEMG-16): a 16-channel, high-fidelity, wrist-wearable sEMG platform built from commercially available components, with design files + firmware to enable **end-to-end reproducibility**.
2) **A device-/domain-robust encoder model** that maps multi-channel muscular activity to **hand pose** (joint angles / kinematic representation), with an explicit focus on **out-of-domain generalization** across:
- unseen users (anatomical variation),
- electrode shifts / rotations / contact changes,
- session-to-session drift,
- dataset / protocol mismatch.

High-level modules (see top-level folders):

- `Hardware/` — **open-sEMG-16** hardware stack (schematics/PCB, electrode layout, enclosure notes, firmware hooks, bring-up docs).
- `src/` — acquisition + preprocessing utilities (streaming, windowing, filtering, normalization, dataset I/O, evaluation harness).
- `data/` — dataset organization, conversion scripts, and format docs (raw → aligned → windowed → model-ready).
- `hand-joint-labeling/` — tooling for pose labeling / alignment (e.g., joint definitions, coordinate frames, annotation utilities).
- `LUNA/` — encoder model code (feature encoder + pose head) and training/eval entrypoints.

> **Status:** still in active development; APIs and folder contents may shift. We aim to keep experiments **config-driven** and results **reproducible** as the codebase stabilizes.

## Acquisition to Dataset to Model: End-to-End Pipeline

This repo is organized around a reproducible pipeline:

### 1) Acquisition & Streaming
- synchronized multi-channel sampling
- timestamping + packetization
- stream integrity checks (drop detection, reordering, CRC if available)
- host-side capture and persistent storage

### 2) Signal Processing
- band-pass filtering (and optional notch)
- per-channel normalization (robust stats recommended)
- windowing (fixed-length frames with overlap)
- optional time–frequency transforms (e.g., STFT / filterbanks) for encoder variants
- augmentation hooks to simulate electrode shift / noise / drift

### 3) Label Alignment (pose supervision)
- consistent hand model definition (joint ordering, DoFs, coordinate frame)
- alignment utilities for pose timestamps vs EMG timestamps
- split generation for cross-user / cross-session / cross-placement evaluation

### 4) Encoder + Pose Head
We focus on an encoder that learns a **shift-tolerant representation** of sEMG:

**Input:** `X ∈ R^{C×T}` (C channels, T samples)  
**Encoder:** temporal feature extractor + cross-channel mixing  
**Head:** regression to pose representation (joint angles / keypoints / low-dim hand state)
